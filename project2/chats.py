# chats.py
#
# Process a text and distill statistics about the bi-gram and tri-gram
# word occurrences in the entered text. It does this by using a dictionary
# of words and bi-grams. Each dictionary entry gives the list of words
# in the text that follow that word/bi-gram (and possibly a count of the
# number of times each follower does so).
#
# The code then generates random text based on these statistics.
#
#
# Usage: python3 chats.py
#
# This command processes a series of lines of text, looking for
# contiguous runs of alphabetic characters treating them each as a
# word. For each such word, it keeps a count of the number of its
# occurrences in the text.
#
# To end text entry hit RETURN and then CTRL-d.  It then generates
# a random text that tries to mimic the text it just processed.
#
#
# Alternative usage: python3 chats.py < textfile.txt
#
# The above instead processes the text of the file in 'textfile.txt'.

    to be "good enough" just to handle the spurious other characters
    that might arise in the kinds of free texts from things like
    Project Gutenberg. Sadly, this also strips out accented characters

DONE.
 not mine own selflove quite contrary i read such art as black as hell as 
 dark as night. cxlviii. o if i could write the beauty of thy deceased 
 lover compare them with the trophies of my speaking breast who plead for 
 love speak well of me? what merit lived in me behold when yellow leaves 
 or none or few do hang upon those boughs which shake against the truth 
 vainly express'd for i have ranged like him that bears me tired with all 
 these for restful death i cry as to behold desert a beggar born and needy 
 nothing trimm'd in jollity and purest faith unhappily forsworn and guilded 
 honour shamefully misplaced and maiden virtue rudely strumpeted and right 
 perfection wrongfully disgraced and strength by limping sway disabled and 
 art made tonguetied by authority and folly doctorlike controlling skill 
 and argument. rise resty muse my love's sweet face survey if time have 
 any wrinkle graven there if any be a satire to decay which husbandry in 
 honour might uphold against the thing they see return of love which time 
 and see thy blood warm when thou my lovely boy who in despite of space 
 i would not dull you with my woe plods dully on to age's steepy night and 
 all those beauties whereof now he's king are vanishing or vanish'd out 
 of sight stealing away the very refuse of thy fair appearance lies. to 
 this false plague are they now transferr'd. cxxxviii. when i perhaps 
 compounded am with clay do not drop in for an afterloss ah do not do the 
 thing it was nourish'd by. this i prognosticate thy end is truth's and 
 beauty's doom and date. if thou lour'st on me this cross but here's the 
 joy my friend? on whom frown'st thou that which thou receivest not gladly 
 or else of thee defeated by adding one thing expressing leaves out difference! 
 'fair kind and true' varying to other words and words express the manner 
 of my speaking breast who plead for love my love receivest i cannot blame 
 thee for my sake so him i lose thee my true love control supposed as forfeit 
 to a summer's day? thou art all my grief lies onward and my sick muse 
 doth give! the rose looks fair but fairer we it deem for that sweet thief 
 which sourly robs from me. cxxxiv. so shall i say mine eyes be blessed?

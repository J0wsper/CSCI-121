#
# This defines the 'world' class, an object that tracks two things for
# the flock simulator:
#
#   * The world of simulated bodies that inhabit the system.
#   * The graphical window that depicts those bodies.
#
# A 'World' has a coordinate system, one that's specified with a
# certain width and a certain height, and whose origin normally sits
# in the center. Bodies that inhabit this world live at points within
# this coordinate system. A world drives the simulation of these
# bodies, and also draws them in its window. The key methods for
# managing the simulation are:
#  
#   addBody: adds a Body object to the system to be simulated
#   addSystem: adds a collection of bodies to the system
#   removeBody: removes a Body object from the simulated system
#   step: advances the simulation by one time step
# 
# Here are the key methods used by the system to draw the contents
# of the simulation:
#
#   render: clears then draws all the bodies' shapes into the window 
#   drawShape: used by 'render' to depict a body. Uses each body's
#      'color' and 'shape' attributes to draw them.
#
# These rely on the underlying tkinter.Frame class from which this
# class inherits. There is also some minimal support for
# interaction---the method 'pointer' (using 'windowCoordToWorld' 
# allows you to ask the world object where the mouse pointer
# sits.
#
